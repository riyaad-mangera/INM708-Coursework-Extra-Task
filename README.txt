Running the model:
	If the pickle has been downloaded, the lime_implementation.py file can be run by itself.
	If the pickle file has not been downloaded, please run train.py to train and save a model.

	which represent what parts of the image the model thought was relevant to the prediction, along
	with a value on how confident it was in its prediction
